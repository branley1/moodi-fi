*   **Spotify Developer Account:**
    1.  Go to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in with your Spotify account.
    2.  Create a new App.
    3.  Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your newly created Spotify App's settings.
    4.  In your Spotify App settings, add `http://localhost:8888/api/spotify-callback` as a **Redirect URI**.  *(Important: Make sure the port `8888` matches your backend server port configuration)*
*   **Google Cloud API Key:**
    1.  Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2.  Create a new Google Cloud Project (if you don't have one).
    3.  Enable the **Gemini API** for your project.
    4.  Create an API key for your project and note it down.
*   **Environment Variables:** You will need to set up environment variables for both the backend and frontend.

**Backend Setup (Server - Port 8888):**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd moodi-fi/backend
    ```
2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.**
    *   Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials and URLs:

        ```
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
        SPOTIFY_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8888/api/spotify-callback
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
        MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI  # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/moodifi
        SESSION_SECRET=YOUR_SESSION_SECRET_KEY # Generate a strong, random secret key
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY         # Generate a strong, random JWT secret key
        NODE_ENV=development                     # Set to 'production' for production deployments
        FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000      # URL where your frontend will be running in development
        API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888       # Base URL of your backend API
        PORT=8888                                # Port for backend server (optional, defaults to 8888 if not set)
        ```
        *   **Important:** Generate strong, random values for `SESSION_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`.  Do not use example secrets in production!
        *   **MONGODB_URI:**  Make sure this points to your running MongoDB instance.
        *   **FRONTEND_URL:**  Ensure this is set to `http://localhost:3000` unless your frontend development server is configured to run on a different port.
        *   **API_BASE_URL:** Should be set to `http://localhost:8888` unless you change the backend server port.
4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or npm start, or node server.js (depending on your scripts in backend/package.json)
    ```
    You should see a message in the console indicating that the backend server is running on port 8888 and connected to MongoDB.

**Frontend Setup (Client - Port 3000):**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # From the backend directory, go up one level and then into the frontend directory
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory.**
    *   Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

        ```
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888  # Base URL of your backend API
        REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # URL where your frontend is running (itself)
        ```
        *   **Important:** `REACT_APP_` prefix is necessary for React to recognize these environment variables.
4.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    You should see a message in the console indicating that the frontend development server is running and accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:5173`, etc., depending on your setup).

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:** In one terminal window, navigate to the `backend` directory and run your backend start command (e.g., `npm run dev`). Ensure it's running on port 8888.
2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:** In a separate terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run your frontend start command (e.g., `npm start`). Ensure it's running on port 3000 (or your configured frontend port).
3.  **Access Moodi-Fi in your Browser:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Moodi-Fi application UI.
4.  **Login with Spotify:** Click the "Login with Spotify" button and follow the Spotify authentication flow.
5.  **Explore Features:** Once logged in, you can use the buttons to fetch your top tracks, generate summaries, and create playlists.

## Scalability and CI/CD Readiness

This project is designed with scalability and CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) in mind, although a full CI/CD pipeline is not yet implemented.  Key aspects supporting scalability and CI/CD include:

*   **Separated Frontend and Backend:**  The frontend React application and backend Node.js/Express API are intentionally separated into distinct directories. This separation allows for independent scaling and deployment of each component.
*   **JWT Authentication:** Using JWT for authentication allows for stateless and scalable API authorization.
*   **Environment Variable Configuration:**  Configuration is driven by environment variables, making it easier to deploy to different environments (development, staging, production) and manage secrets securely.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Basic rate limiting is implemented on API routes to protect against abuse and ensure API stability.
*   **Database Persistence (MongoDB):** MongoDB provides a scalable and flexible database for storing user data and summaries.
*   **Logging (Winston):** Server-side logging is implemented using Winston, which is crucial for monitoring and debugging in production.
*   **Future CI/CD Pipeline:**  The project structure is set up to be easily integrated with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. A future CI/CD pipeline could automate:
    *   Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests).
    *   Building and bundling the frontend React application.
    *   Containerization (using Docker) of both frontend and backend.
    *   Deployment to cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.).

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

*   **Implement Audio Summary Generation:** Fully integrate a Text-to-Speech API to generate and play audio summaries of listening data.
*   **Enhanced AI Summarization:** Explore more advanced prompting techniques and Gemini model features to create even richer and more personalized summaries.
*   **User Profiles and Data Persistence:** Implement user profile management, allowing users to save summaries, generated playlists, and other personalized data.
*   **Playlist Customization:** Allow users to customize generated playlists (name, description, public/private status).
*   **Genre/Mood-Based Playlist Generation:** Enhance playlist generation to create playlists based on specific genres, moods, or activities identified in the user's listening data.
*   **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the user interface and user experience for a more engaging and visually appealing application.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application to a cloud platform.
*   **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend to ensure code quality and stability.
